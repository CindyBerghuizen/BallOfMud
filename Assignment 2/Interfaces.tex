\hline
\bf Issue & The airlines and customers use different services on our systems as a result they will have different options on their interface. This can be accomplished in two ways, either they can have entirely different interfaces or use the same lay-out. \\
\hline
\bf Decision & Two different external sites.\\
\hline
\bf Status & Pending\\
\hline
\bf Group & User Experience;  \\
\hline
\bf Assumptions & None \\
\hline
\bf Constraints & None\\
\hline
\bf Positions &  Have one website, when logged in the interface changes depending on the type of user. \newline\newline
Have two different log in pages so the airlines will never come across the regular user website and vice versa.
\\
\hline
\bf Argument & The second option is more appealing to the airlines, beause they have there own unique landing page. This also limits the users knowledge of the airlines and might help any security issues related to users trying to login as airlines. \\
\hline
\bf Implications & The implications depend on the decision that remains to be taken. \\
