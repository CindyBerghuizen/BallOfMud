This Data Flow viewpoint \ref{fig:Data Flow} illustrates the flow of data within the system. In this picture the review and reporting system are shown as black boxes to illustrate that what is going on in there is of no importance in this picture.
Based on several design decisions the above design was created. The above design focusses on performance and scalability.
This design splits data-mining and stats from the main website data. This allows for performance gain by gaining the ability to use specialized databases. It also allows us to improve scalability by only having to scale either data-mining and stats or the main website database.
To balance the system load, we use a queue for the data. This allows you to use less powerfull servers as you don't have to handle spikes in resource requirements.
