This Data Flow viewpoint \ref{fig:Data Flow} illustrates the flow of data within the back-end of the system. In this picture the review and reporting system are shown as black boxes to illustrate that their functionalitity is of no importance in this picture.
In the related design decisions it was argumented that combining the rating with incremental updates was best for performance and scalability. Note that in the flow only the back-end of the system is given, because of the importance of handling the large data sets. Each of the modules and arrows in the viewpoint are explained here after.

\subsubsection{Polling}

The polling module is responsible for obtaining reviews from external data sources. It polls every external source on a given timeframe which is different for each external source. The reviews are not formatted and there original data format from the external source is kept). The rationale behind the decision is that all the reviews from external sources are significantly different of each other parsing them into a general format would lead to data loss or lot's of undefined fields. The decision is further elaborated in the appendix at \ref{xxx}. The unformatted reviews are then passed on to the event handler as events. An event is defined as a single unformatted review either from external or internal sources. 

\subsubsection{Event handler}

The event handler receives the events from both the polling module (external sources) as from the review system (internal source). The responsibility of the event handler is to send these events to the analytics module specific to that data source. The event handler allows for parallel processing of reviews and greatly increased the performance and scalability compared to a more traditional pipeline model. This decision is further elaborated on in the appendix at \ref{xxx}. 

\subsubsection{Analytics}

Each data source has its own analytics module, because the data must be treated differently from external sources as they are of different format. The seperate analytics modules have the added benefit of allowing for meta-analysis specific to a given data source. An example could be the amount of followers on twitter.  

The analytics module analyzes the unformatted review and produces a rating on a given scale for a certain or multiple categories (Overall, food , timeliness etc.). The unformatted review together with the analyzed ratings are then stored in the analytics database of the data source. The ratings are also send of the combine ratings in order to update the rating of the airline that is related to the review.

\subsubsection{Combine Ratings}

The combine ratings module is responsible for combining the ratings from the individual reviews into a final rating for an airline. The module receives the ratings from the analytics module and obtains the old rating from the main database. These two can are combined in order to form a new rating. The process of iterativly combining ratings instead of recalculating is made for performance reasons as it is much cheaper and efficient to not recalculate the ratings that are already in the final rating of the airline. This decision is discussed in the appendix at \ref{xxx}
