\hline
\bf Issue & It may occur that a flight is delayed due to external factors outside of the airlines responsibilities (e.g. weather). A bad review may affect the airlines rating which may not be considered a desirable effect. Do we want Flight Information to influence the rating of an airline or shall we not regard it. \\
\hline
\bf Decision & The status is still pending awaiting conversation with the involved stakeholders. \\
\hline
\bf Status & Decided \\
\hline
\bf Group & Analysis of data; \\
\hline
\bf Assumptions & Users will write reviews even if factors are outside of the airlines responsibilities. \\
\hline
\bf Constraints & None \\
\hline
\bf Positions & Cross-match flight information from airlines into the rating algorithm to avoid the influence of those reviews towards the rating \newline\newline
Let the airlines search for reviews based on flight information, but not change the rating algorithms. \newline\newline
Leave the flight information out of the system. \\
\hline
\bf Argument & If airlines can influence the rating algorithms than this greatly decreases the transparency of the system. This problem applies to each airline so it does not decrease the fairness of the system. The second option gives airlines the ability to spot the influence of those bad reviews, but not alter their influence. This keeps the system transparent. \\
\hline
\bf Implications &The implications are given after the decision is taken. \\
\hline
\bf Related decisions & Split-up \\

\bf Related requirements  & Flight information, Transparancy \\
