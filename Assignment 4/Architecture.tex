\section{Introduction}
This document provides the architectural decisions together with the learning process. In the first section,  the stakeholders are identified together with their concerns.
The second section contains multiple viewpoints on the architecture of the FlyWithUs system. Finally, Appendix A contains the results of the domain research performed early in the designing process and Appendix B contains the design decisions presented more formally.

\section{Viewpoints}

This section contains three viewpoints on the architecture. These viewpoints were mainly due to the stakeholders concerns. The privacy view provides EU-Claim and the Dutch government the information related to their
main concerns. The data-flow indicates how the system will be able to handle all the data from external and internal sources which is one of the biggest challenges in designing this architecture. The last view shows the functional
requirements of the system of all the available users.

\section{Formal Design Decisions}

This appendix states the design decisions that were taken during the process of designing an architecture. Figure \ref{fig:ddtree} shows the tree of the design decisions that will each be further elaborated on this section.
