\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scope And Summary}
This document provides the current architecture of the FlyWithUs application. FlyWithUs is a new start-up that wants to create a single platform for airlines and users to write and read flight reviews. The platform must combine reviews from other sites as well as reviews from within the FlyWithUs application.
This document identifies the stakeholders, the  requirements, the design decisions and the viewpoints on the current architecture of the FlyWithUs application and contains an overall definition of the architecture. Because FlyWithUs does not currently have any technical employees (developers, testers etc.) these stakeholders are currently left out of scope of this document.
 
\subsection{Viewpoint Overview}
The document contains three viewpoints on the architecture:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Functional Decomposition}. This viewpoint identifies the different users and the supported functionality of the system. It also shows which modules provide which functionality.
\item \emph{Data Flow}. This viewpoint is responsible for showing how data flows through the system.
\item \emph{Concurrency}. This viewpoint explains the performance and scalability of the system along with the tactics used to achieve those.
\end{enumerate}
 
\subsection{Change History}
This document is the result of the first version (29 September, 2013) combined with the feedback received on week 40. In this section the most notable changes are stated:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Concurrency viewpoint instead of privacy. The privacy was redundant given that all the functionality can be shown in the functional decomposition view. 
\item The requirements are stated in appendix ~\ref{sec:requirements}.
\item Clear mapping between domain analysis (Appendix~\ref{sec:domain}) and design decisions (Appendix~\ref{sec:designdecisions}).
\item Rationale behind each view is explained in more detail.
\item Added appendix~\ref{sec:reflections} to show our reflection on the viewpoints .
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Document Organization}
In  section~\ref{sec:definition}, the definition of architecture is discussed, in  section~\ref{sec:stakeholders} the stakeholders are identified together with their concerns. Section~\ref{sec:viewpoints} contains multiple viewpoints on the architecture of the FlyWithUs system. In appendix~\ref{sec:requirements} the requirements of the stakeholders are stated. The design decisions are given in appendix~\ref{sec:designdecisions}. Appendix~\ref{sec:domain} contains the domain related analysis and finally, appendix~\ref{sec:reflections} gives a reflection on the viewpoints that were made. 

\section{Definition of Architecture}
\label{sec:definition}
First four definitions of software architecture are stated and their differences
and similarities are discussed. Second, our own view on software architecture is
given.

\subsection{Definitions on architectures}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Software Architecture is the set of structures needed to reason about the software system, which comprise the software elements, the relations between them, and the properties of both elements and relations.\cite{clemens}

\item Software Architecture is an abstract system specification consisting primarily of functional components described in terms of their behaviours and interfaces and component-component interconnections\cite{hayesroth}

\item Software Architecture is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.\cite{IEEE1471}

\item Software architecture is the study of the large-scale structure and performance of software systems. Important aspects of a system's architecture include the division of functions among system modules, the means of communication between modules, and the representation of shared information.\cite{lane90}
\end{enumerate}

These definitions share the same fundamental idea that software architecture is a set of structures/components \newline
/modules including their properties and the relationships between them. However, each of the definitions highlights certain aspects of architecture more than the others.

\begin{itemize}
\item In \cite{clemens} and \cite{hayesroth} the focus has been put on the end result. The architecture 
is defined as the components themselves (their properties/interfaces) and the relationships between them (interconnections).
\item The definition stated in \cite{hayesroth} lays a focus on the functional components of a software architecture. With words like functional components, 
behaviours and interfaces underlines the importance of declaring the way the components interact with each other.
\item The definition of \cite{IEEE1471} is not limited only to the systems components, their functionalities and connections but also includes in the definition the 
process of designing and maintaining an architecture. It explicitly states that the design process and the principles guiding change are part of the architecture itself.
\item The last definition (\cite{lane90}) presents architecture as the study of a system's structure. As a result architecture contains the modules and the connections between them that build the system. This also becomes clear
from the title of the article \emph{Studying Software Architecture Through Design Spaces and Rules}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Our view on architecture}
We agree with the definitions above on the point that a software architecture is defined as a set of components, their properties, behaviours and the relations between. However, we think that architecture is not only the structure of a software system but also contains the main design decisions that would explain why the system consists of 
these components and include the stakeholders' quality attributes that lead the architects to those decisions. \\ 

Our definition of software architecture would be:
Software architecture is the structure of a software system along with the decisions that lead to this structure. To elaborate, architecture contains the components by which
the system is build up, their functionality, the relations between them and the reason of their existence meaning which requirement of the stakeholders or quality attribute they accomplish.

\section{Viewpoints}
\label{sec:viewpoints}
This section contains three viewpoints on the architecture. These viewpoints were mainly designed to show that this solution satisfies the stakeholders' concerns. The functional viewpoint shows the functional requirements of the system and all the available users. The data-flow indicates how the system will be able to handle all the data from external and internal sources which is one of the biggest challenges in designing this architecture. The last viewpoint shows the concurrency within the system to see which processes can run in parallel and which must be made redundant to avoid single points of failure.

\section{Formal Design Decisions}
\label{sec:designdecisions}
This appendix states the design decisions that were taken during the process of designing an architecture. Figure \ref{fig:ddtree} shows the tree of the design decisions that will each be further elaborated on this section.
