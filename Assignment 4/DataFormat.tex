\bf Issue & The external sources have a unique format related to them. The system needs to be able to combine all these reviews into a final rating of a generalized format. How will we deal with the unique format of the external sources? \\
\hline
\bf Decision & The unique format is kept in before it is analysed. The analysing step converts the unique format into a rating on a category (e.g. food, timeliness) which the system can use and combine. \\
\hline
\bf Status & Decided \\
\hline
\bf Group & Analysis of data; \\
\hline
\bf Assumptions & The data from external sources cannot easily be combined because they all have a significantly different format. \\
\hline
\bf Constraints & None \\
\hline
\bf Positions & Keep the unique format before analysing the data. \newline\newline
Parse the unique format from external sources into a general format the  module can use. \\
\hline
\bf Argument & The external sources contain different layouts parsing them into a general format would either lead to data loss or lot of ‘undefined’ fields. However the analysis module does not need to account for different kinds of data which decreases its complexity. However, the potential loss of data (and maybe meta-data) would decrease the effectiveness of the analysis module. Therefore the decision was made to keep and store the data in a unique format. \\
\hline
\bf Implications & The storage system needs to be able to handle the data from external sources. The analysis module needs to handle multiple lay-outs of the external sources. \\
